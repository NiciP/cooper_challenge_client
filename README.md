## Cooper Assessment Test Challenge

 The project entails the building of a fitness tracking application using a specific test called The Cooper Test.
 The app will allow users to track their condition and have the functionality to present historical data of tests if a user has saved any data.

As there is a very high correlation between the distance someone can run (or walk) in 12 minutes and their VO2 max value - this technique can give a accurate estimate of a persons fitness
This test also allows you to compare your cardiovascular endurance with others of your age and gender.
